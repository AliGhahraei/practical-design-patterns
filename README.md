# Practical Design Patterns

## Documentation
- Each subproject's source is correctly documented and follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Adherence to the standard was tested with an open source tool called [CheckStyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) and also with the help of an Intellij IDEA plugin called [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065).
- Each subproject's corresponding diagram can be found in the diagrams directory, which also contains .xmi files generated with the open source tool [Umbrello](https://umbrello.kde.org).

## Subprojects contained inside this project:
- StarbuzzDecorator
